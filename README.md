### GIEV is a simple and minimalistic approach to list all the developers "Donation" links in one single page. 

You can list all your donation links in a single page. Be it a chrome extension, or a wordpress plugin, or an open source project, you can now direct all the **Donate** links to your GIEV page, from where your donors can choose which platform to use. They don't have to register for a new account, they can opt to pay using a platform they currently have.

### Demo
<a href="https://alanjacobmathew.github.io/GIEV/"> Demo </a>

### Fork it
* Fork this repo. You could name name your repo as "GIEV".
* Update the links with your respective "URLs".
* Ypu can remove the "Made with GIEV" banner
* Publish it as a github page or upload to your server. (If you your the repo name as GIEV, your url will be `https://{username}.github.io/GIEV`)
